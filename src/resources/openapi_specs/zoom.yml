        Deleting a user permanently removes them and their data from Zoom. They will be able to create a new Zoom account with the same email address if they have access to it. An account owner or an account admin can transfer meetings, webinars and cloud recordings to another Zoom user before deleting, but if not transferred, they will be permanently deleted.<br><br>

        By default, this API disassociates (unlinks) a user from the associated account. The disassociation will give them their own basic, free Zoom account. It will not be associated with your account, and they will be able to purchase their own licenses. You can transfer the user's data (meetings, webinars and cloud recordings) to another user before disassociation.<br> To permanently delete a user, specify "delete" as the value of the `action` query parameter.

        List all the schedulers of a user. Schedulers in this context are the users for whom the current user can schedule meetings for.

        For instance, if the current user (i.e., the user whose userId was passed in the path parameter of this API call) is user A, the response of this API will contain a list of user(s), for whom user A can schedule and manage meetings. User A is the assistant of these users and thus has scheduling privilege for these user(s).

        **Prerequisites**:
        * Current user must be under the same account as the scheduler.<br>

        Disassociate a user from one Account and move the user to another Account under the same master account.

        With this API, a user under a master account or a sub account can be moved to another sub account within the same master account. To move a user from a master account to a sub account, use `me` as the value for `accountId`. In this scenario, "me" refers to the Account ID of the master account.

        To move a user from one sub account to another sub account, provide the sub account's Account ID as the value for `accountId`.

        **Prerequisites**:
        * The account should have Pro or a higher plan with master account option enabled.
        * The user whose account needs to be switched should not be an admin or an owner of that account.
        * The user should not have the same [managed domain](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203395207-What-is-Managed-Domain-) as the account owner.

        **Scope:** `user:master`<br>

        An account owner of a Zoom account can establish a [Zoom Rooms Location Hierarchy](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000342983-Zoom-Rooms-Location-Hierarchy) to better organize Zoom Rooms spread accross various location. The location can be structured in a hierarchy with Country being the top-level location, followed by city, campus, building, and floor. The location in the lower level in the hierarchy is considered as a child of the location that is a level above in the hierarchy. Use this API to change the parent location of a child location. <br><br> For instance, if the location hierarchy is structured in a way where there are two campuses (Campus 1, and Campus 2) in a City and Campus 1 consists of a building named Building 1 with a floor where Zoom Rooms are located, and you would like to rearrange the structure so that Building 1 along with its child locations (floor and Zoom Rooms) are relocated directly under Campus 2 instead of Campus 1, you must provide the location ID of Building 1 in the path parameter of this request and the location ID of Campus 2 as the value of `parent_location_id` in the  request body.<br><br>

        Users in the Zoom desktop client and mobile apps are assigned with a [presence status](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360032554051-Status-Icons). The presence status informs users of their contact's availability. Users can also change their own presence status to be either "Away", "Do not disturb", or "Available".

        Use this API to update a user's presence status. A user's status can not be updated more than once per minute, i.e., you can only submit a maximum of 1 update request/minute for a single user.<br>Note that a user's presence status can not be updated using this API if the user is not logged in to the Zoom client.

          **Note:** If the account owner or the admin has configured [minimum passcode requirement settings](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360033559832-Meeting-and-webinar-passwords#h_a427384b-e383-4f80-864d-794bf0a37604), the passcode value provided here must meet those requirements. <br><br>If the requirements are enabled, you can view those requirements by calling either the [Get User Settings API](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/users/usersettings) or the  [Get Account Settings](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/accounts/accountsettings) API.

          If "**Require a passcode when scheduling new meetings**" setting has been **enabled** **and** [locked](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005269866-Using-Tiered-Settings#locked) for the user, the passcode field will be autogenerated for the Webinar in the response even if it is not provided in the API request. <br><br>
